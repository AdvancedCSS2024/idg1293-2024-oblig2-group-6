Emilie started this assigment alone, when Sanna did not answered on messages on both Discord or mc-Teams. 
I started the assignment by extracting the elements from poster2, using Illustrator. First I cleaned up the poster. Cleaned it free from all the elements that wasen't needed. Extracted the elements and exported to svg files. 
Emilie started to make the poster and implementing the svg files. 
Because Emilie was struggeling to make the colored backgrounds with svg, she started to make the backgrounds with css. 

The earth is made with svg path.
The svg persons, the green cloud, the car and the star are implemented with image element. 

In the "footer" it was decided to use justefy-content: space evenly, to make the content easier to read.
