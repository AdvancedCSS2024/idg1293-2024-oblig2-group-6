Emilie started this assigment alone, when Sanna did not answered on messages on both Discord or mc-Teams. 
I started the assignment by extracting the elements from poster2, using Illustrator. First I cleaned up the poster. Cleaned it free from all the elements that wasen't needed. Extracted the elements and exported to svg files. 
Emilie started to make the poster and implementing the svg files.
